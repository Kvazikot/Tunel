----- Topic: New ideas. Tunnel animation.
1. Bricks and arrow of time
You can animate the bricks from which the tunnel is made.
You can give a random impulse to each brick component
tunnel walls AddForce. Each brick uses bump mapping.
But each brick must build interesting figures in 
Escher style of different detail.
 
--- Questions: But one issues arises here, namely,
--- reverse the arrow of time of Unity physics engine's ?
How to reverse time in physX simulation in Unity engine?
  
2. The entrance to the tunnel can be in the form of a snake or dinosaur head.
The camera can fly into the tunnel (flying car)

----- Topic: Implementation of Bezie splines in Tunnel project
Make the point look like a textured quad instead of a sphere.
This will reduce the number of cycles wasted on unnecessary geometry.
Add the ability to build Bezier splines, two more control points.
De Casteljau's algorithm.
The interpolation formula is on Wikipedia. Matrices are not needed there.
Hermitian splines can be retained, or all points can be interpolated with a cubic spline.

----- Topic: Implementation of Bezie splines
1. Create a BezieKnot control point class
Control points are red.
Prepare a texture for a quad point or take a gradient texture
You can write a shader program to do this.
Lines from control points can be displayed by hatching (dotted line)
The spline is colored red.
2. Create a class BezieSpline.
This method creates a point by instantiating prefarb.
How many checkpoints are there maximum?
Transfer point cache logic to BezieSpline.
- Checkpoints can only be shown for the selected segment.
3. The spline interface implements the BezieSplineEditor class with an AddKnot button.
